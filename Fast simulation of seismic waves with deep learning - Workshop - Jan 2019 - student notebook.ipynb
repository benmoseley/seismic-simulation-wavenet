    "\n",
    "- **Seismic simulation** is crucial for many geophysical applications, yet traditional approaches are **computationally expensive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this workshop, we will use **deep learning** to simulate seismic waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will show that this can offer a **fast approximate alternative** to traditional simulation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "For this proof of principle study, we will consider the simulation of **acoustic waves** propagating in synthetic **horizontally layered** media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will consider a single fixed point source propagating through a horizonally layered velocity model with 11 fixed receivers horizontally offset from the source, shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Left: input velocity model, triangles show receiver locations. Right: wavefield pressure after 1 s, using acoustic Finite-Difference (FD) modelling,  black circle shows fixed point source location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a randomly selected layered velocity model as input, can we train a neural network to simulate the pressure response recorded at each receiver location?\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish our neural network to generalise well to velocity models unseen during training. We will compare our results to traditional FD modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following workflow to complete this task;\n",
    "\n",
    "- we will preprocess the input velocity profile into its corresponding reflectivity series;\n",
    "\n",
    "- we will pass this to a deep neural network with a **WaveNet** architecture to simulate the receiver responses;\n",
    "\n",
    "- we will train this network with many example ground truth FD simulations;\n",
    "\n",
    "- we will compare the accuracy and computational performance of the trained network to FD simulation.\n",
